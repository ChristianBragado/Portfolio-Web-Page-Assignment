              <h3>Hey, my name is Christian Bragado!</h3>
            </header>
            <p>I am an aspiring software developer, currently learning at Thinkful and residing in Ventura, California.</p>
            <p>I've been immersed in the tech industry since I can remember; from my dad bringing home the first gateway family computer when I was 8 to spending the last 7 years of my professional career with one of the biggest tech companies in the world at Apple Inc., where I have learned that collaboration is one of the most powerful forces humans have discovered.</p>
            <p> One of my fundamental values is to thrive on learning new skills that have the potential to change the lives of others as well as mine, and I believe that becoming the best web developer I can be is the path to further developing this value.</p>
            <p>When I'm not hammering down Thinkful prep course modules, I spend most of my time enjoying the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Chasing PRs at the gym</li>
              <li>Reading the latest project's white papers and Trading Cryptocurrency</li>
              <li>Piloting FPV drones</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Contact Me!</h3>
            </header>
            <p>I always look forward to meeting new people, so never be shy! Feel free to reach out to me anytime, whether it be about JavaScript errors or the latest layer 2 protocol on the blockchain!</p>
