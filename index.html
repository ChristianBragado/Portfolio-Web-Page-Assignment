              <h2>Hi, My name is Christian Bragado!</h2>
            </header>
            <p>I am an aspiring software developer currently learning at Thinkful and residing in Ventura, California.</p>
            <p>Ive been immersed in the tech industry since I can remember; from my dad bringing home the first gateway family computer when I was 8 to spending the last 7 years of my professional career with one of the biggest tech companies in the world at Apple Inc, Where I have learned that collaboration is one of the most powerful forces humans have discovered.</p>
            <p> A fundamental value of mine is to thrive in learning new skills with immense potential to change the life of others as well as my own, I believe that becoming the best possible web developer I can be is the path to further grow this value.</p>
            <p>When im not hammering down Thinkful prep course modules, I spend most of my time enjoying the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Chasing PRs at the gym</li>
              <li>Reading the latest project's white papers & Trading Cryptocurrency</li>
              <li>Piloting FPV drones</li>
              </ul>
